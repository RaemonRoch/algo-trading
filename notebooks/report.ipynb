    "### Strategy Description and Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Overview\n",
    "- Strategy: Pairs trading (statistical arbitrage) that captures mean-reversion of the spread between two assets (e.g., GOOGL vs AMD). The execution flow and main backtest parameters (splits, fees, borrow rates, windows, thresholds) are orchestrated in main.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Pairs trading approach\n",
    "- Spread definition: model P1 as a linear combination of P2: P1 ≈ beta0 + beta1 * P2; the residual (spread = P1 - (beta0 + beta1*P2)) is traded. Trading logic (spread, z-score, thresholds, history) is implemented in MarketNeutralStrategy.\n",
    "- Signals: compute z-score of spread over a rolling window. Enter when |z-score| > entry_threshold; exit when |z-score| < exit_threshold.\n",
    "- Sizing and execution: StrategyOrchestrator sizes the primary leg as a percentage of capital and sizes the secondary leg via the estimated hedge ratio; order execution, commissions and borrow costs are modeled in Exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Why cointegration indicates an arbitrage opportunity\n",
    "- Intuition: two non-stationary price series can have a stationary linear combination (cointegration). If the spread is stationary (finite mean and variance), large deviations tend to revert—this expected reversion is the basis of statistical arbitrage.\n",
    "- Correlation vs cointegration: correlation measures contemporaneous co-movement; cointegration implies a long-run equilibrium in levels, which justifies trading the spread.\n",
    "- Risks: cointegration doesn’t guarantee quick or sufficiently large reversion to cover trading costs; your implementation models commissions and borrow costs to assess feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Justification for the Kalman Filter for dynamic hedging\n",
    "- Need for dynamic hedge: the hedge ratio (beta1) can change over time due to relative volatility or structural shifts.\n",
    "- Technical advantage: the Kalman Filter provides recursive, adaptive estimates of beta0 and beta1 (state is random-walk; observation is linear), updating every tick without full re-calibration. This reduces hedging error versus a fixed beta. The KF setup and filter_update logic live inside MarketNeutralStrategy.\n",
    "- Practical benefits: improved dynamic coverage, fewer batch re-estimations, faster reaction to regime changes.\n",
    "- Limitations: assumes linear-Gaussian dynamics; large structural breaks or non-linearities can degrade performance and require regime-change detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Expected market conditions for success\n",
    "- Pairs with stable economic/fundamental relationship (same sector, similar exposures).\n",
    "- Sufficient liquidity to limit slippage in both legs.\n",
    "- Low-to-moderate volatility: clearer mean-reversion signals; in extreme volatility, signals can be noisy.\n",
    "- Controlled costs: sensitivity to commissions and borrow fees—these are modeled in Exchange and included in performance reports.\n",
    "- Not recommended during structural breaks (mergers, idiosyncratic news) without detection mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Implementation, validation and metrics\n",
    "- Pipeline & parameters: main.py handles data loading, splits (60/20/20), Exchange and Strategy initialization, and test execution.\n",
    "- Market engine & costs: Exchange models execution, fees, daily borrow costs, and tracks portfolio history and executed trades.\n",
    "- Robustness testing: BackTesting class supports K-Fold evaluation to analyze stability across different time folds.\n",
    "- Metrics: generate_performance_report computes Sharpe, Sortino, Max Drawdown, Calmar and trade stats to quantify cost impact and performance.\n",
    "- Recommendations: sensitivity analysis on rolling_window, entry/exit thresholds and capital allocation; stress-tests with higher fees/borrow costs; monitor hedge_ratio_history and spread/z-score for signal degradation."

    "**Sequential Decision Analysis (SDA) Framework**\n",
    "This framework models the entire trading process as a sequential loop of observing, learning, and acting.   \n",
    "* Detailed Mathematical Formulation of State-Space Model:\n",
    "    The system is defined by a linear state-space model, which includes a hidden state (the hedge ratio) and a measurable observation (the asset prices).\n",
    "    * State Equation (Transition): $X_t = F \\cdot X_{t-1} + \\omega_t$ \n",
    "        * The hidden state $X_t$ is the vector of dynamic regression coefficients: $X_t = [\\beta_{0,t} \\text{ (intercept)}, \\beta_{1,t} \\text{ (slope)}]^T$.\n",
    "        * The transition matrix $F$ is set to the identity matrix (np.eye(2)), modeling the state as a random walk. This assumes the coefficients at time $t$ are the same as at $t-1$, plus some process noise $\\omega_t$.\n",
    "    * Observation Equation (Measurement): $Y_t = H_t \\cdot X_t + \\epsilon_t$\n",
    "        * The observation $Y_t$ is the price of Asset 1: $P_{1,t}$.\n",
    "        * The observation matrix $H_t$ is dynamic and updated at each step: $H_t = [1, P_{2,t}]$, where $P_{2,t}$ is the price of Asset 2.\n",
    "        * The equation expands to: $P_{1,t} = 1 \\cdot \\beta_{0,t} + P_{2,t} \\cdot \\beta_{1,t} + \\epsilon_t$, where $\\epsilon_t$ is the measurement noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Description of Sequential Process (predict $\\rightarrow$ observe $\\rightarrow$ update $\\rightarrow$ decide $\\rightarrow$ act $\\rightarrow$ learn):\n",
    "This loop is executed by the StrategyOrchestrator for each timestamp in the historical data.\n",
    "    * Predict: The Kalman Filter (internally within pykalman) predicts the a priori state $[\\beta_0, \\beta_1]$ for time $t$.\n",
    "    * Observe: The StrategyOrchestrator reads the current market prices $P_1$ and $P_2$ for the current timestamp.\n",
    "    * Update (Learn): The orchestrator calls strategy.get_signals(). This method provides the new observation $P_1$ and observation matrix $[1, P_2]$ to the kf_hedge.filter_update function. The filter calculates the a posteriori (updated) state, effectively \"learning\" the new, most likely hedge ratio.\n",
    "    * Decide: get_signals() uses the updated state to compute the current spread and its Z-score. It compares this Z-score against entry_threshold and exit_threshold to generate a signal: (1: Open Long), (0: Open Short), (-2: Close Position).\n",
    "    * Act: The StrategyOrchestrator receives the signal. If it's an entry signal (1 or 0) and the position is neutral, it calls _open_position. If it's an exit signal (-2) and a position is open, it calls _close_position. These methods execute trades via exchange.execute_trade.\n",
    "* Q and R Matrix Selection with Justification:\n",
    "    * R (Observation Covariance): observation_covariance = 1.0. This represents the variance of the measurement noise $\\epsilon_t$. A value of 1.0 is a standard baseline, implying moderate uncertainty in the observed price relationship ($P_1$ vs. $P_2$) that isn't captured by the hedge ratio.\n",
    "    * Q (Transition Covariance): transition_covariance = np.eye(2) * 1e-5. This represents the variance of the process noise $\\omega_t$. This critically small value is a key design choice. It signifies a strong belief that the hedge ratio coefficients $[\\beta_0, \\beta_1]$ are highly stable and evolve very slowly. This makes the filter smooth and resistant to short-term market noise."

    "* Initialization Procedures:The filter is initialized with a \"prior belief\" about the state:\n",
    "    * initial_state_mean = np.array([0.0, 1.0]): The filter's initial belief is that the intercept is 0 and the slope is 1. This is a neutral and logical starting point for a pair relationship.\n",

    "    * initial_state_covariance = np.eye(2) * 1.0: This initializes the filter with moderate uncertainty about its initial belief, allowing it to converge quickly to the true parameters as it processes new data.\n",
    "* Parameter Estimation Methodology:The state parameters ($\\beta_0, \\beta_1$) are estimated recursively and online. Unlike a static OLS regression, the filter updates its parameter estimates at every single timestamp. This is achieved via the kf_hedge.filter_update method, which optimally blends the previous state prediction with the new observation to produce the most probable current state.\n",
    "* Reestimation Schedule and Validation Approach:\n",
    "    * Reestimation Schedule: The reestimation is continuous. The hedge ratio is re-calculated at every time step (e.g., daily) as new price data becomes available.\n",
    "    * Validation Approach: The overall strategy's performance is validated using the BackTesting class. This class implements K-Fold cross-validation. Crucially, it sets shuffle=False to preserve the temporal order of the data, which is essential for time-series analysis. This allows for performance assessment across multiple distinct \"folds\" or time periods."

    "### Strategy Description and Rationale\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Overview\n",
    "- Strategy: Pairs trading (statistical arbitrage) that captures mean-reversion of the spread between two assets (e.g., GOOGL vs AMD). The execution flow and main backtest parameters (splits, fees, borrow rates, windows, thresholds) are orchestrated in main.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Pairs trading approach\n",
    "- Spread definition: model P1 as a linear combination of P2: P1 ≈ beta0 + beta1 * P2; the residual (spread = P1 - (beta0 + beta1*P2)) is traded. Trading logic (spread, z-score, thresholds, history) is implemented in MarketNeutralStrategy.\n",
    "- Signals: compute z-score of spread over a rolling window. Enter when |z-score| > entry_threshold; exit when |z-score| < exit_threshold.\n",
    "- Sizing and execution: StrategyOrchestrator sizes the primary leg as a percentage of capital and sizes the secondary leg via the estimated hedge ratio; order execution, commissions and borrow costs are modeled in Exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Why cointegration indicates an arbitrage opportunity\n",
    "- Intuition: two non-stationary price series can have a stationary linear combination (cointegration). If the spread is stationary (finite mean and variance), large deviations tend to revert—this expected reversion is the basis of statistical arbitrage.\n",
    "- Correlation vs cointegration: correlation measures contemporaneous co-movement; cointegration implies a long-run equilibrium in levels, which justifies trading the spread.\n",
    "- Risks: cointegration doesn’t guarantee quick or sufficiently large reversion to cover trading costs; your implementation models commissions and borrow costs to assess feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Justification for the Kalman Filter for dynamic hedging\n",
    "- Need for dynamic hedge: the hedge ratio (beta1) can change over time due to relative volatility or structural shifts.\n",
    "- Technical advantage: the Kalman Filter provides recursive, adaptive estimates of beta0 and beta1 (state is random-walk; observation is linear), updating every tick without full re-calibration. This reduces hedging error versus a fixed beta. The KF setup and filter_update logic live inside MarketNeutralStrategy.\n",
    "- Practical benefits: improved dynamic coverage, fewer batch re-estimations, faster reaction to regime changes.\n",
    "- Limitations: assumes linear-Gaussian dynamics; large structural breaks or non-linearities can degrade performance and require regime-change detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Expected market conditions for success\n",
    "- Pairs with stable economic/fundamental relationship (same sector, similar exposures).\n",
    "- Sufficient liquidity to limit slippage in both legs.\n",
    "- Low-to-moderate volatility: clearer mean-reversion signals; in extreme volatility, signals can be noisy.\n",
    "- Controlled costs: sensitivity to commissions and borrow fees—these are modeled in Exchange and included in performance reports.\n",
    "- Not recommended during structural breaks (mergers, idiosyncratic news) without detection mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Implementation, validation and metrics\n",
    "- Pipeline & parameters: main.py handles data loading, splits (60/20/20), Exchange and Strategy initialization, and test execution.\n",
    "- Market engine & costs: Exchange models execution, fees, daily borrow costs, and tracks portfolio history and executed trades.\n",
    "- Robustness testing: BackTesting class supports K-Fold evaluation to analyze stability across different time folds.\n",
    "- Metrics: generate_performance_report computes Sharpe, Sortino, Max Drawdown, Calmar and trade stats to quantify cost impact and performance.\n",
    "- Recommendations: sensitivity analysis on rolling_window, entry/exit thresholds and capital allocation; stress-tests with higher fees/borrow costs; monitor hedge_ratio_history and spread/z-score for signal degradation."
